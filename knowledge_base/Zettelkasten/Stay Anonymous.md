1. Connect VPN + TOR in this arrangement: You -> TOR + VPN -> VPN -> destination
2. do some google dorks for stolen credit card dumps.
3. Buy BTC with them
4. Send the BTC to another address in your wallet. Do this atleast 3 times.
5. Send your BTC through a mixer service.
6. Again, send your new mixed BTC to another address in your wallet. I’d say do it 3 times again. The more the better.
7. Buy a virtual credit card with your BTC.
8. Hire a VPS with that VCC. Use a fake identity if needed.
9. …
10. Profit.
