Service to switch token from one chain like Ethereum to another chain like Polygon
[[Layer 0]] <-> [[Layer 1]] <-> [[Layer 2]]

### Via Centralized entity
- 2 Pools on 2 chains with exchangeable Tokens
- put your Tokens in one pool and the entity will give you the same token representation from the other pool on the second chain
- When one pool is completely empty you need to wait until someone uses the bridge again and fills the pool

### Via Smart Contract
